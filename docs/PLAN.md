# Implementation Plan

**Authoritative task tracker for this repository.** There is exactly one; no other file
mirrors it. Process rules live in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (§3).

## Status: IMPLEMENTATION, task IPP 1 (plasma shape)

Event: Fri 23 Oct 2026 16:00 to Sat 24 Oct 14:00. Requirements: [`REQUIREMENTS.md`](REQUIREMENTS.md).
Decisions: [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md).

Statuses: `TODO` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `DONE`. A task is `DONE` only when its acceptance
criteria are met **and verified** (`AGENTS.md` §15).

## Task board

| ID | Task | Status | Acceptance criteria | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PREP-1 to PREP-4 | Repository inspection, workflow, documentation system, git identity | DONE | See `DECISIONS.md` DEC-001 | Commits on `origin/main` |
| PREP-5 | Analyze the assignment specification | DONE | Requirements extracted and classified in `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Source file read in full; five tasks compared; task chosen (DEC-002) |
| IMPL-1 | Data intake | DONE | Magnetic data downloaded, extracted into its own folder, read-only, profiled | `analysis/profile_data.py` output; 42,972 rows, 57 columns, 149 discharges |
| IMPL-2 | Exploratory analysis | DONE | Structure, missing values, noise, redundancy of inputs, traps written down | `analysis/ipp1_eda.py`; figures; `DECISIONS.md` DEC-003 |
| IMPL-3 | Baseline models (ridge, small neural network), group split by discharge | IN PROGRESS | Per-parameter accuracy and latency, 5 folds | `analysis/ipp1_baseline.py` output (REQ-001) |
| IMPL-4 | Required analyses: accuracy per parameter, stability over time, real-time verdict, fewer inputs | TODO | REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004 | Notebook outputs |
| IMPL-5 | Robustness to noise and drift; amount of data; time context | TODO | REQ-B02, REQ-B04, REQ-B06 | Notebook outputs |
| IMPL-6 | Camera data: download (876 MB), match images to rows | IN PROGRESS | Zip complete and checked; mapping to rows verified | File size and a checksum of the extracted images |
| IMPL-7 | Camera model | TODO | REQ-B01, REQ-B03, REQ-B05 | Notebook outputs |
| IMPL-8 | Notebooks that run top to bottom, README and results table | TODO | REQ-005 | Clean run on a second machine |
| IMPL-9 | Presentation, video, motion reel | TODO | REQ-006 | Delivered files |

## Open questions and blockers

See `REQUIREMENTS.md` (OQ-001 to OQ-004). No blocker for IMPL-3 to IMPL-5.

## Milestones (checkpoints, Fri to Sat)

| Time | Checkpoint |
|---|---|
| Fri 18:00 | Baseline table and latency recorded |
| Fri 22:00 | All required analyses have a number and a graph |
| Sat 02:30 | Everything runs top to bottom in the notebooks |
| Sat 08:00 | Polish; reel first cut can start |
| Sat 10:00 | Feature freeze |
| Sat 12:00 to 13:00 | Submission checklist and submit |
